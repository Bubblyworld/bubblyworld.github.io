I feel like "consciousness" is a word that can cast confusion and mystery over a conversation. Some people get bogged down trying to find a rigorous, analytic definition of consciousness. Others proclaim that consciousness is merely an illusion, or that _everything_ in the universe is conscious, or even that the _universe itself_ is one singular, global consciousness. Things like "philosophical zombies" come up, the "chinese room experiment" is mentioned, and maybe somebody wonders about the "inverted spectrum" argument.

Maybe some of these thought experiments are useful, and maybe some of these philosophical positions have some truth to them. But what frustrates me about it all is that after reading about these things - and contemplating them - I'm left just as confused as I began. None of them feels to me like it lifts much of that confusion, at least not when I compare it to the feeling of insight I get from reading about, say, the Doppler effect.
